### Context

In general, via GitHub API, you can actually create an issue. However, sometimes it's better to just open an issue form in browser, so the user can still edit it. It can be achieved via [URL query params](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-url-query).
